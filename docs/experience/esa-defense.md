# ESA, TNO & Atos Origin - Aerospace & Defense

[:material-arrow-left: Back to Experience](index.md)

## Company Context

Through TNO (Netherlands Organization for Applied Scientific Research) and Atos Origin, I contributed to spacecraft systems for the European Space Agency (ESA) and defense applications. These sectors represent the ultimate test of engineering discipline: once hardware launches into space, there are no repair visits. Software must work correctly the first time, every time.

## Role & Responsibility

**Developer** - Contributing to spacecraft and defense system development through government and aerospace contractors.

## The Reality: No Second Chances

Aerospace and defense work operates under constraints that fundamentally shape engineering approach:

- **Spacecraft systems**: Once in orbit, there's no way to physically repair hardware failures
- **Defense applications**: Lives and national security depend on system reliability
- **Long operational lifetimes**: Systems must function for years or decades without maintenance
- **Harsh environments**: Radiation, extreme temperatures, vibration—conditions that break consumer hardware
- **Rigorous testing requirements**: Failure analysis, redundancy planning, comprehensive validation

## Key Insights

### Design for Zero-Touch Operations
When you can't send a technician, systems must handle failures gracefully, automatically recover when possible, and provide clear diagnostics for remote intervention. This mindset—designing for minimal human intervention—applies directly to modern automation.

### Test Everything, Assume Nothing
Aerospace testing regimens go far beyond "it works on my machine." Every failure mode must be analyzed. Every edge case explored. Every assumption validated. This rigor becomes instinctive and carries over into all engineering work.

### Redundancy and Fallbacks
Single points of failure are unacceptable. Critical systems need backup paths, graceful degradation, and well-defined failure modes. Defense and aerospace engineering teaches you to think systematically about what happens when things go wrong.

### Documentation as Discipline
In sectors with decades-long operational lifetimes and high personnel turnover, comprehensive documentation isn't optional. Future engineers must understand design decisions, failure modes, and system behavior without access to original developers.

## The "Once in Space, No Repairs" Principle

This phrase captures the essence of aerospace engineering discipline: you must get it right before launch. While modern software allows for updates and patches, the underlying principle remains valuable—build systems that work correctly from deployment, not systems that require constant intervention.

## Technologies

- **Domain**: Spacecraft systems (ESA), defense applications (TNO)
- **Environment**: Mission-critical with extreme reliability requirements
- **Focus**: Redundancy, failure analysis, comprehensive testing, long-term operations

## What I Learned

**Aerospace and defense teach you that perfect isn't optional**: In most software development, you can release with known bugs and patch them later. In spacecraft systems, that approach doesn't work. This background instilled a discipline about correctness, testing, and failure planning that shapes everything I build.

The experience also taught humility. When you've worked on systems where smart engineers still encountered unexpected failures after rigorous testing, you learn to respect complexity and never assume "it should work."

## How This Experience Applies to Your Business

Aerospace and defense work taught me to build automation with mission-critical discipline:

- **Right the first time**: Design for correctness, not continuous patching
- **Failure planning**: Systematic thinking about what goes wrong and how to handle it
- **Minimal intervention**: Systems that operate reliably without constant attention
- **Long-term thinking**: Building for operational life, not just initial deployment

While your business automation doesn't face space radiation or battlefield conditions, the engineering principles still apply. Building systems that work reliably, handle failures gracefully, and require minimal intervention creates business value whether you're processing documents or managing spacecraft.
