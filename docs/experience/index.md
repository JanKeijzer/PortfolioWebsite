# Professional Experience

Over three decades, I've built systems where failure isn't an option—from life-safety healthcare platforms to spacecraft systems, from financial trading infrastructure to defense applications. Each role shaped my approach to reliability, scale, and mission-critical engineering.

These experiences inform how I approach AI automation today: building systems that businesses can depend on, architecting for growth, and maintaining the rigor that mission-critical work demands.

## Why This Background Matters for Your Automation

When you hire someone to automate critical business processes, you need confidence the systems will actually work. My mission-critical background means:

- **Reliability by design**: Three decades building systems that can't fail translates to automation you can trust
- **Scale without breaking**: I've supported 100% YoY growth—your automation will grow with your business
- **Zero-downtime mindset**: Learned from sectors with financial and life-safety penalties for outages
- **Enterprise rigor**: Security, compliance, and audit trails aren't afterthoughts—they're foundational
