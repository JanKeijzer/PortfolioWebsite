# The Hidden Cost of Customer Support: Why Agents Spend More Time Typing Than Talking

![Customer Support AI](images/customer-support-ai.png)

You call your energy provider. Something's wrong with your bill. The agent is friendly, asks the right questions, looks things up. Ten minutes later, it's sorted.

What you don't see: that same agent then spends another eight minutes documenting the call. What was the issue. What was agreed. What follow-up is needed. All typed manually into a CRM system, while the next caller is already waiting.

<!-- more -->

That's the reality for most service teams. Agents often spend more time on documentation than on the actual conversation. And when it gets busy, those notes get shorter, messier, or skipped entirely. The result: the next colleague who picks up the phone hears "I don't have any record of that."

Now imagine that summary just exists. Automatically. Within seconds after the call. Not perfect, but 90% complete - the issue, the agreement, the next step. The agent reviews it, adjusts if needed, done. Next caller.

This isn't hypothetical. JetBlue already does it. They save nearly five minutes per chat on average. Over a single quarter, that adds up to 73,000 agent hours freed up for actual customer contact. Researchers from Stanford and MIT measured a 14% productivity gain at a large organisation - and 34% for newer employees, because they no longer struggle to document things they've only just learned.

The point isn't that AI replaces the agent. The point is that the agent can finally do what you hired them for: listen, solve, and move on.
